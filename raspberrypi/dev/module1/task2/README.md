# Generative Art Installation: Colorful Cascading Waterfall

## Artistic Vision

This generative art installation draws inspiration from Anders Lind's "LINES" to create an immersive visual experience. It simulates an upward cascading rain of colorful particles, with elements of randomness in color, transparency, size, and movement.

## Instructions (for cloning Github repo and running on local machine - for running on Pi, program will be launched from reboot!)

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Open `genart.html`:** Locate and open the `genart.html` file in this repository folder using your preferred web browser.

3. **Experience the Art:** Upon opening `genart.html`, the generative art installation will start!

## Technical Notes

- **Slight Background Fade:** The art includes a subtle background fade to enhance fluidity and color blending.

- **Lack of Audio Input:** Due to constraints, the art does not use audio input to generate particles but provides a consistent visual experience.

- **Performance Optimization:** The code includes memory management to ensure smooth performance, removing particles when they become invisible.
