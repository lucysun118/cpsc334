Connecting with PI:
Ssh into via laptop 
Dialout check
Plugged esp32 into pi type A
In terminal: ls /dev/tty*
Found which one was the esp32: /dev/ttyUSB0
Program w joystick: analog input:
https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-joystick 
Connected joystick via wires to the esp32
Connected esp32 to laptop
Uploaded and compiled the code
Checked out with serial monitor
For the python code, used pyserial to read input from esp32 when it was connected to pi - code in joystick_esp32.py
Very helpful link for reading input from esp32: https://www.instructables.com/Python-Serial-Port-Communication-Between-PC-and-Ar/
  GNU nano 5.4                       esp32_arduino.py                                 
import serial


ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0')  # open serial port


while True:
        receivedString = ser.readline()[:-2]
        receivedString = str(receivedString,'utf-8')
        print(receivedString)


Debugging
Printing out the Serial.println / Serial.write input from the ESP via the input devices without line break and random characters: added the line to the python file before printing it: “receivedString = str(receivedString,'utf-8')”
Program with button: digital input
https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-button
Connected button via wires to esp32
Connected esp32 to laptop
Uploaded and compiled the code
Checked out press and release events with serial monitor
When connected to pi, used the same script as last time - and it worked!
Debugging
Used wires instead of breadboard to connect button to ESP32 using a mapping of pins diagram linked here^
Program with switch: digital input
https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-switch 
Connected switch via wires to esp32
Connected esp32 to laptop
Uploaded and compiled the code
Checked out press and release events with serial monitor
When connected to pi, used the same script as last time - and it worked!
Debugging
Didn’t really run into any problems - just realized that i couldn’t use GPIO17 as suggested by the esp32io.com source because it was already taken up by the joystick
So i just used GPIO16 after consulting the diagram
Combining the 3 input devices into one .ino Arduino script:
Just copy and pasted the script into one and flashed to the raspberry pi
Final script combining all 3 inputs is under “final_arduino_joystick_button_switch.ino” in the same directory
